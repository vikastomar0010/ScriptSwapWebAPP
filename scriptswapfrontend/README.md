# Code Converter

## Project Description
The Code Converter is a powerful tool designed to convert source code from one programming language to another seamlessly. This project aims to aid developers by providing a reliable and efficient way to transform code, whether for learning purposes, refactoring, or migrating projects.

## Features
- **Multi-Language Conversion**: Supports conversion between various programming languages including JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and C.
- **File Upload**: Allows users to upload a file and convert its content from one language to another.
- **Downloadable Output**: Provides the option to download the converted file, ensuring ease of use and integration into your workflow.
- **Real-Time Conversion**: Instant conversion with a user-friendly interface, ensuring a smooth experience.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling to manage and report any issues during the conversion process.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React.js for building a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for efficient and scalable styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for handling file uploads and conversion logic.
- **State Management**: Use of modern state management techniques to handle file states and conversion processes.

## How to Use
1. **Upload Your File**: Click on the 'Upload File' button to select the file you want to convert.
2. **Select Languages**: Choose the source and target programming languages from the dropdown menus.
3. **Convert**: Hit the 'Convert' button to start the conversion process.
4. **Download**: Once the conversion is complete, click the 'Download' button to get your converted file.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
